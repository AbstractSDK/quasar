# Concepts

The purpose of `intergamm` module is to provide a layer to access other chains via IBC, more particularly with Interchain Accounts (ICA).

Quasar Vault modules such as Orion (Osmosis) can use `intergamm` to allocate funds to DEX living in separate chains. This is needed to implement Vault deposit strategies.

At the moment, only **Osmosis** chain is supported.
