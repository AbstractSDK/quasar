# Concepts

The purpose of `intergamm` module is to provide a layer to access other chains via IBC, more particularly with Interchain Accounts (ICA).

Other Quasar modules such as Qbank can use `intergamm` to deposit funds to DEX living in a separate chain. This is needed to implement Vault deposit strategies.

At the moment, only **Osmosis** chain is supported.
